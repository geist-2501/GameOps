# GameOps
A suite of tools designed for game asset development with Blender and HardOps.

### How to install.
Simply add the contents to a ` .zip ` archive and then install through blender like any other addon.

## Included Tools.

### Zip Splits.
Zip splits simply works like 'Merge by Distance' except it doesn't merge the vertices - it just moves them.

### [IN DEV] Generate High + Low.
Takes the source mesh and automatically applies modifiers in the correct order to make a high and low poly mesh.

### [PLANNED] Auto Exporter.
Exports the high and low poly meshes as ` .fbx ` files with the appropriate suffixes.

### [PLANNED] Auto Unwrapper.
Just unwraps all the meshes via the sharpened edges. The UV map will still need work.
